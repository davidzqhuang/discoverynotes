# Box 3 Effects of Changes in Expected Profitability on the Introduction of New Drugs
If expected profitability of new drugs declined—because of a change in federal policy, a shift in demand or supply, a revision in the balance of power between drug companies and drug buyers, or for any other reason—the expected returns on drug R&D would decline as well. Lower expected returns would probably mean fewer new drugs, because there would be less incentive for companies to spend on R&D. (If expected profitability were to rise, the opposite effects would occur.) Expectations about returns on R&D partly depend on expectations of prices that future drugs could command—which, in turn, partly depend on current drug prices and influences on those prices.

The Congressional Budget Office’s analysis of H.R. 3 in the 116th Congress illustrates those effects. That bill would have required the Secretary of Health and Human Services to negotiate prices for drugs—primarily those for which spending was highest—and to subject manufacturers who did not participate in negotiations to an excise tax. In that analysis, CBO concluded that the bill would reduce drug companies’ expectations about future revenues because of the new negotiating leverage of the Secretary. The prospect of such lower revenues would make investments in R&D less attractive to pharmaceutical companies. CBO estimated that under the bill, approximately 8 fewer drugs would be introduced to the U.S. market over the 2020–2029 period and about 30 fewer drugs over the subsequent 10 years.1 Those estimates were in the middle of the distribution of possible outcomes, in CBO’s assessment, and were uncertain. CBO’s analysis is in line with a broader literature that has found a positive relationship between drug prices and R&D efforts.2
