# R&D Costs of a New Drug
R&D spending is also influenced by the expected costs of developing a new drug, including those incurred in the preclinical research phase and in clinical trials. In addition to those out-of-pocket expenses, drug companies incur capital costs that result from tying up funds in the drug-development process for years before they generate earnings from those investments. Those capital costs reflect the returns that the funds could have earned if they had been invested in other ways.

Development of a drug that will eventually reach the market often entails a decade or more of R&D expenditures. Each successive phase of clinical trials requires increasing amounts of spending. Drug developers can reassess their commitment at each stage, and a drug’s expected value may change as more is learned in clinical trials or as market conditions change—that is, there is an option value to continuing. Companies will not necessarily cancel a drug project even if its likely future costs exceed its likely value when that assessment is made, because the expected value might rise with additional information about the drug or its market.

Pharmaceutical research is inherently risky and canceled or failed projects are a normal part of any drug development program. Companies initiate drug projects knowing that most of them will not yield a marketable drug. Some drugs developed in the preclinical phase never enter clinical trials, and of those that do, only about 12 percent reach the market (recent estimates range from 10 percent to 14 percent).14

Estimates, from multiple sources, of average R&D expenditures per new drug range from less than $1 billion to more than $2 billion. Those estimates all include capital costs as well as expenditures on drugs that did not make it to market. The different estimates are averages over different samples of companies and drugs—that is, they depend on analytical and sampling choices made by the researchers producing those estimates and are best interpreted as illustrative of the general conclusion that developing new drugs is expensive and subject to high rates of failure.

Preclinical Phase. Although drugs spend much less time in preclinical development than they do in clinical trials, a company’s total preclinical R&D expenditures typically constitute a considerable share of its total R&D spending. That is because companies typically develop many potential drugs in the preclinical phase that never enter or complete clinical trials. According to one estimate using data provided by large pharmaceutical firms, preclinical development accounted for an average of 31 percent of a company’s total expenditures on drug R&D, or $474 million per approved new drug.15

When capital costs were taken into account, the share of R&D spending in the preclinical phase rose to 43 percent. Any return on R&D spending on early, preclinical drug development must await successful completion of both the preclinical phase and the clinical trials that follow. As a result, the lag between investment and return is longer for R&D spending that occurs in the preclinical phase than for spending in clinical trials. (For drugs that do not reach the market, no return is realized, although lessons learned from those efforts may aid the development of other drugs.) According to one study, the preclinical phase takes an average of about 31 months, followed by around 95 months, on average, for clinical trials—or about 10.5 years from start to finish.16 Other estimates differ; in a sample of 10 cancer drugs, for example, one study found that the median time from discovery to approval was 7.3 years.17 Those numbers are measures of central tendency: Some drugs are brought to market in less time.18

Clinical-Trials Phase. The costs to conduct clinical trials on a drug are higher than those to conduct the preclinical phase because trials involve the contributions of many more people for a longer time. Clinical trials occur in several phases:

Phase I trials (also known as human-safety trials) test a potential new drug at different dosage levels, generally in a small group of healthy volunteers in order to assess its safety in humans. For drugs with high levels of expected toxicity, phase I trial subjects are people with the targeted illness.
Phase II trials are larger and include only people with the medical condition the drug is intended to treat. Phase II trials assess the drug’s biological activity and identify and characterize any side effects.
Phase III trials are larger still and assess a drug’s clinical effectiveness. They can take years to complete. The smaller a drug’s expected therapeutic effect relative to a placebo, the larger the number of patients that are needed in the drug’s phase III trials so that the drug’s true effect (if any) can be distinguished from random variation in patient outcomes.
Phase IV trials (also known as pharmacovigilance trials) may be conducted after a new drug has reached the market. They look for side effects not seen in earlier trials and measure a drug’s efficacy over longer periods of use than were studied in earlier trials.
Generally, only drugs that have successfully navigated the first three phases can be considered for FDA approval, although regulators sometimes approve new drugs without a phase III trial. (Of the 59 drugs approved in 2018, 7 did not undergo phase III trials before approval.)19 In some cases the FDA may require a phase IV trial after the drug is approved to detect adverse reactions that might not be observed until a drug is in wider use. Drug companies also might choose to conduct phase IV trials to show (for marketing purposes) the superiority of their product over other available drug therapies.

Few of the drugs that enter clinical trials are ultimately approved; some fail in clinical trials, and others are set aside when a company decides to focus on more promising drugs. In a few cases, drugs submitted for approval are rejected by the FDA. In one sample of drugs in clinical trials, researchers found that for every 100 drugs entering phase I trials, around 60 advanced to phase II trials, just over 20 entered phase III trials, and only about 12 gained FDA approval.20 Such winnowing is reflected in the average R&D cost per approved drug, which includes all of the R&D spending on drugs that do not reach the market.

Costs tend to rise in each successive phase of development. In the sample just described, companies spent an average of about $1,065 million in clinical trials per approved new drug (more than twice the amount spent in the preclinical research phase). Spending averaged $28 million in phase I, $65 million in phase II, and $282 million in phase III.21 For each drug that completed the first three phases of clinical trials, the average total cost of those trials was about $375 million. The remaining $690 million (of the $1,065 million in average total spending on clinical trials) reflects companies’ contemporaneous spending on drugs that failed in clinical trials or were otherwise set aside.

Capital Costs of R&D. In addition to the cost of preclinical research and clinical trials, drug companies incur costs by forgoing other opportunities for investment with money spent on clinical trials. Because drug companies’ R&D spending on a drug occurs over many years, those capital costs are substantial and can approach the value of actual R&D expenditures to develop a new drug.

Estimates of Total R&D Costs. Three recent studies have estimated the average R&D cost per new drug. They all measure R&D costs the same way: They add up all of the R&D spending by each company in their sample—not only its spending on the sampled new drug but the company’s spending on other drugs that were being developed at the same time but that did not reach the market. The studies also all apply a cost-of-capital adjustment to each company’s R&D spending to reflect the lag between investment and return on investment.22 Despite their methodological similarities, the studies’ estimates range from $0.8 billion to $2.3 billion of R&D spending per new drug.

Differences in sample selection and data sources appear to be important sources of variation in those estimates. The largest estimate, $2.3 billion (from a 2016 study, expressed here in 2019 dollars), includes around $900 million in preclinical research spending and $1.4 billion for clinical trials.23 Those estimates are based on a sample of 106 randomly selected drugs from 10 large pharmaceutical firms, 5 of which are ranked among the industry’s top 10 by sales revenues, with an additional 3 ranked in the top 50 but outside the top 25.24 That widely cited study is the latest in a series of similar studies the authors have published over the past three decades. Because the R&D expenditures reported by the sampled firms are not publicly available, it is difficult to evaluate the extent to which the results of those studies are affected by the selection of the sample and other aspects of the method of collecting data.25 An independent effort to replicate an earlier iteration of the study found similar results, however.26

The second study, which was conducted in part to provide an alternative to those 2016 estimates, found an average R&D cost of $1.2 billion (expressed here in 2019 dollars), with expenditures for individual drugs ranging from $137 million to $5.8 billion.27 That upper bound, based on one outlier drug accounting for $2.2 billion in actual R&D outlays and $3.6 billion in capital costs, skews the average estimate upward. The median R&D cost, unaffected by the outlier, is $0.9 billion.

The sample in that study consisted of 63 drugs (developed by 47 different companies) out of the 355 drugs that the FDA approved between 2009 and 2018. R&D expenditure data for those 63 drugs are publicly available (unlike the data used in the 2016 study). The sample skews toward smaller firms—although the same is now true of drug development generally—and the authors caution that their sample may overrepresent drugs approved between 2014 and 2018 and those in certain therapeutic areas, first-in-class drugs, orphan drugs, and therapeutic agents that received accelerated approval. The R&D data include the companies’ spending on drugs that did not reach the market.

In the third study, researchers limited their sample to new cancer drugs from companies with no previously approved products. They found an average cost of $0.9 billion per approved drug (expressed here in 2019 dollars).28 Notably, that study excluded R&D spending by firms that had not developed any approved drugs, and thus the study underestimates R&D spending on failed drugs and, by extension, expected costs per new drug. Median observed R&D costs in that sample were about $0.8 billion per new drug, with estimates for individual drugs ranging from about $212 million to $2.7 billion including capital costs. Those estimates include the developers’ total R&D spending while the approved drugs were under development, including that on failed drugs.

Trends in R&D Costs. R&D costs have increased by about 8.5 percent per year over roughly the past decade.29 The increase in average R&D costs might reflect changes in the kinds of drugs being developed or in the number of drugs in costly clinical trials. If success rates for new biologic drugs were lower than for traditional, small-molecule drugs, or if R&D spending on failed drugs was higher for biologics, that would also contribute to higher average R&D costs.

Some evidence suggests that average success rates may indeed have declined. The 2016 study found that fewer than 12 percent of the drugs entering phase I clinical trials ultimately reached the market, but it reported success rates in excess of 20 percent for drugs developed in the 1980s and 1990s.30 However, other evidence suggests that the overall success rate of clinical trials has not declined.31

Another possible factor in rising R&D costs is that it has become harder to recruit candidate patients into some kinds of clinical trials.32 For example, prospective patients might be less interested in taking a chance on untested treatments in clinical trials when approved treatment options are relatively effective already. And, in some therapeutic classes, it has become more difficult to demonstrate that a new drug would improve on the existing standard of care. For example, advances in oncology treatments have extended cancer patients’ expected lifespans. As a result, clinical trials on potential cancer drugs have had to be expanded or extended so that the treatment effect on the lifespans of patients can be estimated with suitable precision. That is, because oncology treatments have become more effective, it now takes longer, on average, to observe a given number of deaths in a clinical trial.33
