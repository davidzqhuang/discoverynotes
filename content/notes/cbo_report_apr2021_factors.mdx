# Factors That Influence R&D Spending

Pharmaceutical companies invest in R&D in anticipation of future profits. For each drug that a company considers pursuing, anticipated returns depend on three main factors: the expected lifetime global revenue from the drug (minus its manufacturing and marketing costs), the new drug’s likely R&D costs, and policies that affect the supply of and demand for prescription drugs. When the anticipation of future profits is higher, companies invest more in R&D and produce more new drugs, CBO estimates. Similarly, if expectations about prices and profits were lower, companies would invest in less R&D, and fewer drugs would be developed (see Box 3).

## Anticipated Revenues
A company’s expectations about the revenues it could earn from a drug depend on the prices that the company anticipates the drug could command in various markets around the world and the quantities that the company anticipates might be purchased at those prices. Those expectations are informed by the prices and sales volumes observed for existing drugs in various markets. For established drug companies, current revenue streams from existing products also provide an important source of financing for their R&D projects.

## R&D Costs of a New Drug
R&D spending is also influenced by the expected costs of developing a new drug, including those incurred in the preclinical research phase and in clinical trials. In addition to those out-of-pocket expenses, drug companies incur capital costs that result from tying up funds in the drug-development process for years before they generate earnings from those investments. Those capital costs reflect the returns that the funds could have earned if they had been invested in other ways.

Development of a drug that will eventually reach the market often entails a decade or more of R&D expenditures. Each successive phase of clinical trials requires increasing amounts of spending. Drug developers can reassess their commitment at each stage, and a drug’s expected value may change as more is learned in clinical trials or as market conditions change—that is, there is an option value to continuing. Companies will not necessarily cancel a drug project even if its likely future costs exceed its likely value when that assessment is made, because the expected value might rise with additional information about the drug or its market.

Pharmaceutical research is inherently risky and canceled or failed projects are a normal part of any drug development program. Companies initiate drug projects knowing that most of them will not yield a marketable drug. Some drugs developed in the preclinical phase never enter clinical trials, and of those that do, only about 12 percent reach the market (recent estimates range from 10 percent to 14 percent).14

Estimates, from multiple sources, of average R&D expenditures per new drug range from less than $1 billion to more than $2 billion. Those estimates all include capital costs as well as expenditures on drugs that did not make it to market. The different estimates are averages over different samples of companies and drugs—that is, they depend on analytical and sampling choices made by the researchers producing those estimates and are best interpreted as illustrative of the general conclusion that developing new drugs is expensive and subject to high rates of failure.

## Public Policy
Federal policy influences pharmaceutical companies’ R&D spending, both in magnitude and direction. (Policies in other countries and at other levels of government can also affect such spending. Those policies are outside the scope of this report.)

Policies around federal health care programs and subsidies most directly affect the demand for new drugs. Other policies affect the supply of new drugs (federal support for basic research, tax treatment of R&D spending, and those policies that affect market exclusivity). Still other areas of federal policymaking affect both supply and demand (vaccine policies and regulatory policies).

Changes in policy that increased the demand for pharmaceuticals or encouraged their supply would tend to make R&D activity a more attractive investment. Policy changes in the opposite direction could make it a less appealing one.
