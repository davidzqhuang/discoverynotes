# Figures for Research and Development in the Pharmaceutical Industry

Figure 2.
Average Annual Approvals of New Drugs by the FDA
From 2015 to 2019, the FDA approved about twice as many new drugs as it did a decade earlier. Biologic drugs make up a growing share of FDA approvals.

R&D Spending and New Drug Approvals
Sustained increases in pharmaceutical R&D spending do not necessarily lead to rising numbers of new drugs. R&D spending also reflects rising costs of labor (skilled researchers) and capital (laboratory technologies).

Figure 4.
Total U.S. Retail Drug Spending by Therapeutic Class, 2009 and 2019
New drugs can lead to large increases in retail spending because they have higher prices, they are in high demand, or both. Spending decreases can result when patent protection expires on leading drugs and low-cost generic versions are introduced.

Worldwide and Domestic Revenues of PhRMA Member Firms
Revenues from drug sales have grown substantially since 1980, although that growth was interrupted by patent expirations of some widely used drugs and by the 2007–2009 recession. Revenue growth has since resumed, in part due to expensive new drugs.

Federal Funding for the National Institutes of Health, Fiscal Years 1995 to 2020
Large increases in funding for NIH—the locus of much of the federal government’s basic biomedical research support—in the late 1990s and early 2000s preceded a decade of declining funding. Since 2016, NIH funding has increased annually.
