# Public Policy
Federal policy influences pharmaceutical companies’ R&D spending, both in magnitude and direction. (Policies in other countries and at other levels of government can also affect such spending. Those policies are outside the scope of this report.)

Policies around federal health care programs and subsidies most directly affect the demand for new drugs. Other policies affect the supply of new drugs (federal support for basic research, tax treatment of R&D spending, and those policies that affect market exclusivity). Still other areas of federal policymaking affect both supply and demand (vaccine policies and regulatory policies).

Changes in policy that increased the demand for pharmaceuticals or encouraged their supply would tend to make R&D activity a more attractive investment. Policy changes in the opposite direction could make it a less appealing one.

Federal Health Care Programs and Subsidies. A variety of federal health care programs and subsidies increase demand for health care services and products, including prescription drugs. Such initiatives indirectly stimulate spending on drug R&D. In particular, the federal government—through Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE, the Veterans Health Administration, the Children’s Health Insurance Program, and health insurance marketplaces established by the Affordable Care Act—purchases or subsidizes the purchase of a substantial number of prescription drugs on behalf of retirees, veterans, persons with disabilities, and low-income households. Taken together, federal and state expenditures on prescription drugs accounted for about 40 percent of total U.S. retail expenditures on prescription drugs in 2019.34

Changes to those programs would influence R&D spending. For instance, when Medicare Part D (Medicare’s prescription drug benefit) was implemented in 2006, sales of prescription drugs to enrollees increased considerably. In addition, for Medicare enrollees with full Medicaid benefits, coverage of prescription drugs shifted from Medicaid to Medicare Part D, increasing the average prices paid for those enrollees’ brand-name drugs. Those increases in current and anticipated revenues encouraged the industry to develop new drugs for the Medicare population. Between 2003 and 2010, the number of drugs entering phase I clinical trials increased by roughly 50 percent in therapeutic classes with relatively high sales to Medicare enrollees. That increased development activity eventually led to increases in the number of drugs in those classes.35

The federal government also increases demand for prescription drugs by subsidizing employment-based health insurance: An employer’s contribution toward the cost of that coverage is excluded from an employee’s taxable income, effectively reducing its price to the employee. As a result, many people select more generous health insurance coverage than they otherwise would, which increases their spending on health care (including prescription drugs) and indirectly stimulates pharmaceutical R&D. That stimulus would disappear if the tax subsidy on employment-based health insurance was eliminated. The size of the effect that would have on R&D spending would depend on how the elimination of the subsidy would affect individuals’ choices of health insurance coverage.36

Support for Basic Research. The federal government is the primary funder of basic research in biomedical sciences. That research ultimately increases the supply of new drugs because drug companies rely on the findings from that research—for example, the identification of disease targets toward which new drug therapies can be aimed. That basic research creates knowledge that, in effect, reduces private companies’ R&D costs and stimulates private investment in R&D, because it expands the set of potentially profitable drug development opportunities. In particular, increases in basic health-related research at the NIH or other federal research agencies have been found to increase private drug R&D in therapeutic classes related to that basic research.37

The rationale for public investment in basic biomedical research is that private firms’ incentives to invest in it are muted. Basic research generates knowledge (such as the identification of a disease target) that is not readily embodied in a marketable product (such as a drug). The more of that information a company could keep to itself, the greater its value to the company—and the stronger the company’s incentive would be to invest in that research. But because information can be communicated at low cost, it can be difficult to contain within a firm. Private companies tend to be reluctant to conduct basic research such as identifying a new disease target, because it would be difficult to keep much of the value of that discovery for themselves. For example, once a disease target is known, multiple companies (not just the company that identified it) might be able to develop drugs aimed at that target. That weakens private incentives to invest in basic research and, as a result, private firms do too little of it from the perspective of society as a whole (meaning that the social benefit if they performed additional basic research would be greater than the cost).

The Role of NIH-Funded Research. In the past two decades, federal funding for NIH has totaled over $700 billion.38 Much of that funding has supported basic research (in genomics, molecular biology, and other life sciences) that has identified new disease mechanisms. Federal support for NIH nearly doubled between 1995 and 2003, rising from $18 billion to about $37 billion (see Figure 6). Federal funding for NIH declined (in inflation-adjusted dollars) each year from 2003 to 2015, when that funding was about $33 billion. With real annual increases over the subsequent five years, funding for NIH reached $41 billion in 2020.

Large increases in funding for NIH—the locus of much of the federal government’s basic biomedical research support—in the late 1990s and early 2000s preceded a decade of declining funding. Since 2016, NIH funding has increased annually.

Between 2010 and 2016, every drug approved by the FDA was in some way based on biomedical research funded by NIH.39 In many cases, new drugs targeted a disease mechanism that had been identified by advances in basic science resulting from that funding. Indeed, most of the important new drugs introduced by the pharmaceutical industry over the past 60 years were developed with the aid of research conducted in the public sector.40 Publicly funded basic science thus provided the foundation upon which complementary work on the applied science of drug development could be undertaken by the private sector.

How NIH-Funded Research Affects Private R&D. Empirical studies find that public-sector research tends to increase private R&D rather than to decrease it—that is, they are complements, not substitutes.41 Several recent studies have associated increases in NIH-funded basic research with increased private R&D efforts.42 One study found that in the decade following an increase in NIH funding, private R&D spending grew by about eight times as much as the increase in that funding.43 Another study found that for every two NIH research grants, about one new private-sector patent was awarded.44

The complementary relationship between public and private R&D spending arises mainly because NIH funding focuses on basic research that leads to the discovery of new drugs, whereas private spending focuses on applications of such research. Private R&D spending on clinical testing, incremental innovation, product differentiation, and safety all follows from basic research.

That relationship is complicated by two factors. First, the distinction between basic and applied research is not well defined, and the likelihood that federal research spending crowds out private R&D spending varies by type of research. The risk of crowding out is greater when the government funds research whose potential commercial applications are obvious and valuable, as was the case when federal and private research labs raced to map the human genome. Second, federal research spending can also indirectly crowd out private spending by increasing the demand for skilled researchers. That could cause an increase in research labor costs in the private sector as well as in the public sector.45

Tax Treatment of R&D Spending. The tax code increases the supply of new drugs in two ways: First, it provides tax credits for certain R&D expenditures (including credits available to all types of companies and credits specifically for developing drug treatments for uncommon diseases). Second, it allows all types of companies to deduct expenditures that are not eligible for the credits as business expenses in the year they are made. Both incentives encourage R&D spending by reducing its cost to the company.

Tax Incentives. The research and experimentation tax credit, available to all types of companies for certain qualifying R&D expenditures, directly reduces the amount of income tax a company owes.46 That tax credit has been modified over time and was made permanent by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 (Public Law 114-113).47 Some of the increase in R&D spending by pharmaceutical industries over the past several decades might have been a response to changes in that credit. In addition, the Orphan Drug Act (P.L. 97-414), enacted in 1983, created a tax credit to encourage the development of drugs to treat relatively uncommon diseases. Companies can also choose to deduct the cost of R&D investments immediately rather than over the life of the investment. Many companies use both tax credits and the ability to accelerate their deductions for investments in R&D, although only one tax preference may be used for any particular investment expense.

Effects of the 2017 Tax Act. The net effect of P.L. 115-97 (originally called the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and called the 2017 tax act in this report) on R&D investment is uncertain. Investment in R&D is encouraged by the reduction in the top corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent because earnings on new drugs would be taxed at a lower rate.

Investment is discouraged by changes in how deductions for R&D expenditures can be taken. The act is expected to reduce the value of tax deductions for R&D when they take effect. Beginning in 2022, companies will deduct their annual R&D costs over a five-year period rather than receiving the full tax deduction in the year the expenses are incurred. That discourages investment in R&D because the value of that deduction will decline. The reduction in the top corporate tax rate will further reduce the value of the tax deduction.

The 2017 tax act also reduced the tax credit created by the Orphan Drug Act from 50 percent to 25 percent of the cost of clinical trials.48 When combined with the lower tax rate, that change will reduce the first-year tax benefits for R&D spending on orphan drugs by about 40 percent. (Costs applied to the tax credit for orphan drugs cannot also be applied to the research and experimentation credit, nor can they be deducted as expenses.) That change will also discourage investment in drug R&D.

Policies Affecting Market Exclusivity. The federal government has adopted a variety of policies that grant periods of market exclusivity to manufacturers in order to increase the supply of new drugs. During those periods, the average prices for those new drugs are higher than they will be later, once lower-priced, generic versions are allowed to enter the market. The return on R&D spending provided by those higher prices encourages companies to develop new drugs. That incentive is not unlimited: A manufacturer only receives market exclusivity over its own drug. There may be competing drugs in the same therapeutic market, and companies may introduce other new drugs into that market, providing they do not infringe the existing drugs’ patents.

The primary way that the federal government grants innovators temporary market exclusivity is through the U.S. patent system. Most patents expire 20 years after the date on which the patent application was filed, but pharmaceutical companies can receive several additional years of patent protection in recognition that patented drugs cannot be sold until they complete clinical trials. (Drug patent applications are often filed before the drug enters clinical trials, because disclosures from those trials could be considered “prior art” that might invalidate a patent if its application were filed after those disclosures occurred.) In recognition that a drug might spend several years of its market exclusivity in clinical trials, earning no revenue, the Hatch-Waxman Act (P.L. 98-417) allows pharmaceutical companies to seek up to five years of additional patent protection.

Pharmaceutical companies can also receive additional exclusivity—distinct from that afforded by patents—for drugs that treat relatively uncommon diseases. The Orphan Drug Act, enacted in 1983, offers seven years of market exclusivity (for the designated orphan use, irrespective of remaining patent life) for drugs that either treat conditions affecting fewer than 200,000 persons in the United States or that, in the FDA’s judgment, face market conditions making it unlikely that an innovator could recover its R&D costs. The Orphan Drug Act appears to have led to an increase in the number of new drugs for rare diseases.49

Policies Affecting Generic Drugs. In addition to extending the period of market exclusivity on brand-name drugs, the Hatch-Waxman Act (enacted in 1984) also supports the development of generic drugs. It extends drug patents by up to five years but encourages competition from generic drugs once the patents on a pioneering drug have expired.

The legislation allows the FDA to approve most generic drugs without clinical trials. Instead, a manufacturer must show that its drug is pharmaceutically equivalent to the brand-name drug it copies, with the same active ingredients and no significant differences in the rate and extent of absorption at the site of drug action in the body.

The legislation also allows the FDA to extend by three years a brand-name drug’s market exclusivity for incremental changes, such as new indications, dosing regimens, or patient populations. (The FDA only grants that additional exclusivity when the manufacturer has conducted clinical trials that the agency judges were essential.)50

Thus, the act strengthened incentives to develop new drugs by extending drug patent life, and it made it easier for lower-cost generic versions to be introduced when the drugs enter the public domain by allowing the FDA to approve most generics based on pharmaceutical equivalence rather than clinical trials.

Policies Affecting Biosimilar Drugs. Congress has sought to provide inducement to the development of biosimilar drugs—the analog, for biologic drugs, of the generic copies of small-molecule drugs. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (P.L. 111-148) created an abbreviated pathway for FDA approval of biosimilar drugs. The manufacturer of a proposed biosimilar drug must demonstrate that the drug is “highly similar to and has no clinically meaningful differences from” the pioneering biologic drug.51 In addition, biosimilar manufacturers do not need to conduct as many clinical trials as were conducted for the pioneering drug because they can cite the FDA’s safety and effectiveness determinations for the original biologic drug.

So far, that legislation has resulted in relatively few approved biosimilar drugs compared to the effect that the Hatch-Waxman Act had on the development of generic drugs. As of December 2020, the FDA had approved only 29 biosimilar drugs, and not all of them have been introduced.52 Of the $125 billion in reported domestic retail spending on biologic drugs in 2017 (expressed here in 2019 dollars), $11 billion was spent on biologics for which biosimilar versions are available, and only $0.9 billion was spent on those biosimilars.53

The relative lack of competition for pioneering biologic drugs might contribute to the shift in new-drug development toward biologic drugs instead of small-molecule drugs. In part, that shift might simply reflect advances in the underlying science. But biologic drugs are also attractive targets of research because they are harder to copy. The patent system does not require the original innovator to share the original cell line. Manufacturers seeking to make a biosimilar drug must develop their own living cell line to use as the basis for the new drug. By contrast, the primary challenge in making a generic copy of a small-molecule drug is to replicate the original drug’s active molecule, which is publicly disclosed in the patent. In addition, even under the abbreviated pathway specified by the FDA, biosimilar drugs must still be put through some clinical trials; unlike generic drugs, biosimilar drugs cannot avoid them altogether.54

Biologic drugs may face less competition than small- molecule drugs. Independent of (but concurrent with) patent protection, the FDA grants pioneering biologic drugs 12 years of guaranteed exclusivity in contrast to 5 years of exclusivity for small-molecule drugs.55 In addition, where biologic drugs are concerned, consumers may not as readily accept a biosimilar substitute as they do a generic drug, because a biosimilar is not identical to the drug it imitates.56 Consumer acceptance may be increasing with greater availability and familiarity with biosimilars. However, certain federal payment policies and private contractual agreements may discourage the use of biosimilars.57 With the possibility of facing less competition even beyond the period of market exclusivity, makers of biologic drugs would anticipate greater lifetime sales of those drugs as well.

Vaccine Policies. Several federal policies increase the demand for vaccines and therefore R&D spending to develop them. The federal Vaccines for Children program provides vaccines at no cost to children who might otherwise go unvaccinated because of their family’s inability to pay. Additionally, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention publishes a schedule of recommended childhood and adult vaccinations, including specific recommendations for various groups, such as health care providers, travelers, expectant mothers, racial and ethnic populations, and people with certain underlying health conditions. Those recommendations induce individuals to have themselves and their children vaccinated, and federal subsidies lower the costs to consumers of those vaccinations. A study that analyzed the effects of such policies found that the recommendation in 1991 that infants be vaccinated against hepatitis B and the expansion of Medicare coverage to include the cost of influenza vaccination in 1993 were both associated with subsequent increases in the development of new vaccines.58 Those findings suggest that manufacturers expected demand for vaccines to increase as a result of the new recommendations.

Federal policies also affect the supply of vaccines. The same study considered the federal Vaccine Injury Compensation Fund, which was established in 1986 to encourage manufacturers to develop and supply new vaccines by indemnifying the manufacturers against lawsuits arising from adverse reactions to childhood vaccines. The study found that the fund’s introduction was associated with increased development of new vaccines.

In 2020, the federal government invested directly in the development of vaccines by providing more than $19 billion in funding to support the private development of vaccines to prevent COVID-19 through its Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (see Box 2).

Regulatory Policies. Federal regulatory policies that affect either drug supply or drug demand can influence drug companies’ returns on R&D spending, which would in turn affect the amount they were willing to spend on R&D. Proposed regulation of some drug prices would affect the sales volumes of existing drugs and, as a result, expected returns on R&D on future drugs; in turn, lower expected returns would result in fewer new drugs. Changes to regulation of clinical trials would also affect the supply of new drugs.

Drug Prices. U.S. markets are subject to less price regulation than are the markets in many other countries. Drug companies can mostly set their own prices, although some federal agencies purchase drugs at prices subject to a statutory cap, impose statutory limits on how quickly a manufacturer can raise its prices, or receive rebates from manufacturers that are specified in statute.59

In 2019, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 3, which would have required the Secretary of Health and Human Services to negotiate with drug manufacturers over the domestic prices of certain high-priced, single-source drugs to ensure that they were no more than 20 percent higher than the average prices for those drugs in specific other countries. Under H.R. 3, drug manufacturers that did not agree to participate in negotiations or that failed to agree to a negotiated price would have been subject to an excise tax. The combination of income taxes and excise taxes on a drug’s sales might have caused the manufacturer to lose money if the drug were sold in the United States. Those taxes would have had the same effect as if the drug had not been approved for sale or as if there were a formulary—that is, a national list of drugs that insurers could cover—from which the drug was excluded. Therefore, the potential use of the excise tax would have served as a source of pressure on drug manufacturers in negotiations and would have lowered drug prices and federal spending, CBO estimated.60 (For a discussion of the effects of lower prices on the introduction of new drugs, see Box 3.)

More generally, state laws mandating or encouraging substitution of generic drugs for their brand-name equivalents help lower drug prices.61 In addition, most Medicare Part D plans encourage the substitution of generic drugs for their brand-name equivalents.62 And although the existence of generic drugs is enabled by the patent system’s disclosure requirement (compelling drugmakers to disclose the molecular structure of a drug’s active ingredient), several federal regulatory decisions hasten the introduction of those drugs.63 Under the Hatch-Waxman Act, generic drugs shown to contain the same active ingredient as the pioneering drug do not need to be tested in clinical trials, as described above. The act also provides legal protections from claims of patent infringement to manufacturers who try to develop generic versions of a pioneering drug before its patents have expired and from liability for adverse events not listed on the label of the pioneering drug.64

That competition from generic drugs—which can also reduce the demand for new drugs entering those markets—has tended to discourage investment in drug R&D.65 Several studies have found that a real 10 percent decrease in the growth of drug prices would be associated with about a 6 percent decrease in pharmaceutical R&D spending as a share of net revenues.66

Clinical Trials. A substantial R&D expense that can account for more than half of R&D spending (excluding capital costs), clinical trials are conducted in accordance with federal requirements. As a result, changes to federal policy regarding clinical trials can meaningfully affect private R&D spending. In particular, policymakers have made several changes to federal regulations governing clinical trials in an effort to reduce the time they take and therefore lower their cost.

For example, FDA’s guidance, described above, on how drug companies can establish bioequivalence between a biosimilar drug and the pioneering biologic drug is intended to minimize the expenses of clinical trials associated with developing biosimilar drugs.67 The Prescription Drug User Fee Act, enacted in 1992, provided the FDA with additional resources to hasten the drug approval process, which reduced both the time to market and the capital costs of new-drug development.

More recently, federal policymakers have allowed the use of “surrogate endpoints” in drug trials for certain illnesses, including HIV infection and some cancers, to shorten some clinical trials. Surrogate endpoints include indirect, predictive indicators (such as blood pressure, cholesterol level, tumor size, T-cell counts, or other physical signs of disease), along with other test results and laboratory measures.68 The FDA can approve certain kinds of drug for sale in the U.S. based on clinical-trials results that rely on such surrogate measures rather than on direct measures of a drug’s clinical benefit.

The use of surrogate endpoints has helped neutralize a tendency in privately funded research to emphasize treatments that can be commercialized more quickly, which can result in too little investment in clinically valuable treatments that would take longer to develop.69 Speedier clinical trials can also benefit patients by hastening the introduction of life-extending therapies like the HIV antiretroviral treatments developed in the 1990s.70 However, relying on surrogate endpoints means that consumers might spend money on some drugs that would turn out to have little clinically meaningful effect.
