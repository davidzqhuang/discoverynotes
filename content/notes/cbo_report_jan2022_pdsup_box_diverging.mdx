### Box 2: Diverging Trends in Retail and Net Prices

The divergence between net and retail prices coincides with sizable increases in the rebates that “payers”—such as commercial insurers and federal health care programs—receive from manufacturers. For Medicare Part D, the average rebate on a brand-name drug, as a fraction of its retail price, has more than doubled since 2009, increasing from 15 percent to 35 percent of the program’s spending for brand-name drugs at retail prices in 2018. For Medicaid, the rebate percentage increased from 44 percent in 2009 to 63 percent in 2018. Recent research has found that, on a nationwide basis, average rebates for brand-name drugs have increased as well, from 32 percent in 2012 to 48 percent in 2017.[^1]

In general, consumer cost sharing is not directly affected by those increases in rebates. Instead, rebates tend to be shared among all enrollees in a given plan through reductions in premiums.

#### Factors That Increase Rebates

Some of those increases can be traced to statutory requirements. In the Medicare Part D program, manufacturers have been required since 2011 to provide a discount known as the coverage gap discount. That discount constitutes a substantial portion of the retail prices paid by beneficiaries on the manufacturers’ brand-name drugs while they are within the coverage gap. (Also known as the donut hole, the coverage gap represents a range of spending for which beneficiaries were required to pay the full cost of their prescription drugs. Although the coverage gap was eliminated by legislation in 2019, the term is still defined in federal law to refer to that phase of the benefit.) The discount was originally set at 50 percent of the retail price and was increased to 70 percent in 2019. In the Medicaid program, rebates have increased both as a consequence of the additional statutory rebate provided to Medicaid for drugs whose retail prices rise faster than inflation and because of the increase in the minimum rebate as required by the Affordable Care Act. However, the adjustment is limited by a cap on the total rebate Medicaid receives for a drug: It cannot exceed the drug’s average manufacturer price.[^2]

Rebates may also have grown as a consequence of increased competition. The availability of substitute drug therapies gives insurance plans leverage they can use to negotiate larger rebates from manufacturers—for instance, by threatening to favor another manufacturer’s drug by offering it to beneficiaries for a smaller copayment. The Medicaid program benefits indirectly from that leverage because commercial insurance plans use it to negotiate larger rebates for themselves, and the Medicaid rebate on brand-name drugs is partially based on the largest rebate received by any of those plans. Many Medicaid programs also engage in negotiation with manufacturers on a smaller scale, bargaining over supplemental rebates they would receive in exchange for placing a drug on a preferred drug list.[^3]

#### How Rebates Affect Consumers’ Costs

Net prices are usually a better measure than retail prices of what consumers and insurance plans actually pay for a drug.
