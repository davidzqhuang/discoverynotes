Diverging Trends in Retail and Net Prices

In particular, net prices reflect manufacturers’ net revenues and the effect of drug spending on insurance premiums. However, there are several exceptions. For example, consumers enrolled in a plan with a deductible for prescription drugs pay the retail price of a drug until they meet that deductible. (A deductible is the amount of spending an enrollee incurs before an insurer begins covering expenses.) In addition, in plans with a coinsurance requirement, enrollees pay a percentage of the drug’s retail price rather than making a copayment of a fixed dollar amount. (Coinsurance is cost sharing in the form of a set percentage of the drug’s cost. A copayment is a specified dollar amount that an enrollee pays at the time a drug is purchased.) Furthermore, average cost sharing for Medicare Part D beneficiaries is required to be based on retail prices—which means that beneficiaries pay for a larger share of net drug spending as rebate percentages grow.

Consumers do not get the rebates directly. But with competitive forces in insurance markets and regulatory medical loss ratio (MLR) requirements, consumers probably receive a substantial fraction of those rebates—in the form of lower premiums or more generous benefits. The MLR provisions require insurers to devote at least 80 percent of their enrollees’ premium payments—85 percent for large group plans—to paying claims or making quality improvements. Failing that, they must provide a rebate equal to the difference between that requirement and what the plan actually paid in claims to their enrollees. [^4^]

As a result, rebates benefit all enrollees in a plan, regardless of the number or type of prescription drugs they purchase.

Some enrollees make higher out-of-pocket payments that are based on the prices their plans pay to pharmacies, rather than on net prices that account for manufacturers’ rebates. That is particularly true of enrollees in Part D plans because their benefit designs are required to be actuarially equivalent to a plan with the standard benefit design. (The standard benefit calls for a coinsurance rate of 25 percent once the deductible is met—until the catastrophic threshold is reached.) In addition, cost sharing in the coverage gap tends to take the form of coinsurance rather than a flat copayment. When competition from other drugs leads to larger rebates and lower net prices, that 25 percent coinsurance constitutes a larger share of the net price than for drugs with net prices that are closer to retail prices—that is, for drugs with less competition (or generic drugs). As a result, enrollees who are more likely to use brand-name drugs that face competition from other drugs pay a greater share of net drug costs than enrollees who primarily use generic drugs or brand-name drugs without therapeutic competition.

That dynamic was one of the factors that led CBO to estimate in 2019 that premiums for the Medicare Part D benefit would increase under the Proposed Rule on Safe Harbors for Pharmaceutical Rebates. [^5^] CBO anticipated that the rule would result in pharmacies’ charging beneficiaries prices for prescription drugs that reflect the discounts that pharmacy benefit managers negotiate with manufacturers. Enrollees who use brand-name drugs that face greater competition and have larger rebates would benefit from the lower cost sharing that results from rebates being applied when the prescription is purchased. However, directing part of those rebates toward reducing cost-sharing payments would reduce the amount of rebate dollars that could be used toward reducing
