## Box 1: The Flow of Payments and Products in Prescription Drug Markets

Markets for prescription drugs purchased at pharmacies in the United States are served by a complex supply chain, with payment flows involving multiple actors, including intermediaries (such as pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, which negotiate prices but do not distribute or dispense the products). The supply process begins with pharmaceutical manufacturers selling their output to wholesale distributors. The distributors resell those drugs to pharmacies, at prices that may have been negotiated by group-purchasing organizations on behalf of members, including pharmacies. Pharmacies package the drugs into prescriptions and sell them a third time, to consumers. As a result, the concept of “price” differs depending on the entity that is receiving payment—or paying—for a prescription.

### Payments That Pharmacies Receive

The retail price of a drug at the pharmacy counter is determined by negotiations between pharmacies and insurers (or their PBMs) and reflects both wholesale and retail markups. Those markups compensate the wholesaler and pharmacy, respectively, for the services they provide and for their inventory costs. The retail price of a given drug is probably similar for most payers.[^1] (Payers are the entities that pay for prescription drugs, namely commercial insurers and federal health care programs, as well as individuals without insurance coverage for prescription drugs.) Consumers who have not yet satisfied their insurance plan’s annual deductible pay that retail price or possibly much less if the manufacturer has a coupon program for that drug and the consumer is eligible for the program. (A deductible is the amount of spending an enrollee incurs before an insurer begins covering expenses.) Consumers with health insurance who have met their deductible pay only a portion of the retail price, as specified by their plan’s copayment or coinsurance schedule; the remainder is paid by their plan or its PBM. (A copayment is a specified dollar amount that an enrollee pays at the time a drug is purchased. Coinsurance is cost sharing in the form of a set percentage of the drug’s cost.) Consumers without insurance may pay a pharmacy’s “usual and customary” price—which tends to be higher than the retail prices paid by other payers—or may pay a discounted amount using a coupon program such as GoodRx.[^2]

### Prices That Insurers Pay

For insurance plans, a drug’s retail price bears little relation to the plan’s costs for prescription drug claims, especially in the case of brand-name drugs. The actual price to the insurer is largely determined by the rebate, the negotiated payment it later receives from the manufacturer. (Manufacturers of generic drugs generally do not offer rebates to insurance plans, although they pay rebates to pharmacies.)[^3] The size of the rebate, which varies by drug, health insurance plan, and enrollees’ total purchases of the drug in that plan, is negotiated in advance by the insurer or the insurer’s PBM. (That process is described below in the section titled “Negotiations With Manufacturers.”) For brand-name drugs, the PBM may achieve its markup by retaining a small portion of the manufacturer’s rebate, with the remainder going to the insurer or payer. The insurer, in turn, shares most of the rebate with its enrollees in the form of lower premiums or more generous benefits on its insurance coverage.[^4] For generic drugs, there is generally no rebate to share; consequently, the PBM may mark up the net prices of those drugs or may instead charge the plans higher fees for its administrative services.

### Negotiations With Manufacturers

The process by which net prices are negotiated is similar for most insurance plans,[^2][^3][^4]
