## The Flow of Payments and Products in Prescription Drug Markets

- Although the net prices themselves can vary widely across those plans. A PBM bargains with a manufacturer for a larger rebate on a drug in exchange for preferred placement of that drug in a plan’s formulary (or list of covered drugs). Those negotiations may also include stronger restrictions on—or exclusion of—competing drugs as well as “price protection” rebates that protect the PBM and plan against large price increases during the benefit year.

- For drugs in the preferred tier of a plan’s formulary, enrollees typically have a lower copayment or coinsurance rate and may face fewer restrictions—such as the requirement that a beneficiary obtain prior authorization before purchasing a drug. The opposite is true for drugs in nonpreferred tiers. (Drugs in nonpreferred tiers generally have higher cost-sharing requirements or more restrictions on utilization than drugs in preferred tiers.) Net prices for the Medicaid program are heavily influenced by rebates determined by statutory rules, though smaller supplemental rebates may be negotiated by states through a similar process in exchange for placement on a preferred drug list.5

- That process generally does not extend to drugs that must be administered by a physician. In such cases, the insurer often reimburses the administering physician who provided the drug rather than purchasing it from a pharmacy. Those drugs tend to be covered by an insurance plan’s medical benefit rather than its pharmacy benefit. For that reason, the pricing for physician-administered drugs mostly relies on the prices that physicians pay to purchase those drugs.

- Manufacturers tend to offer larger rebates on drugs that face competition from other products. (In the absence of competition, a pharmaceutical company may offer only minimal or no rebates.) That applies to rebates for commercial insurance plans as well as to those provided to Medicare Part D, which is administered by private insurers. A large share of rebates provided to Medicaid, by contrast, are not directly negotiated, although they partly depend on the rebates negotiated by commercial insurers. Specifically, Medicaid receives the

- greater of the largest rebate paid to any commercial insurer or a statutory minimum rebate (currently 23.1 percent of the average manufacturer price, or AMP—the average price that wholesalers have paid for drugs they sell to retailers or that retailers paid directly to manufacturers).

### Payments From Pharmacies

- Pharmacies are another source of post-sale payments to PBMs and plans that reduce the net prices they have paid for prescription drugs. Such payments, which generally take the form of fees that pharmacies pay to PBMs and plans, are much smaller than those from manufacturers and can apply to purchases of both brand-name and generic drugs.6
- Those fees are generally related to inclusion of a pharmacy in a plan’s network of preferred pharmacies or to discounts associated with prompt payment.7

### Additional Rebates Paid to Medicaid and Other Federal Payers

- Rebates paid to Medicaid are also subject to the inflation-adjustment provision described in the section of the report titled “Comparing Prices Among Payers.” Most states also negotiate with manufacturers for supplemental Medicaid rebates in exchange for providing beneficiaries easier access to the drugs associated with those rebates. Other federal payers negotiate discounts that make the prices paid by those programs substantially lower than net prices in Part D but somewhat higher than those paid by Medicaid.8
- Although manufacturers of generic drugs do not generally pay a negotiated rebate to insurers, Medicaid receives a statutory minimum rebate, currently 13 percent of the AMP plus an inflation-based rebate, on generic drugs.
6. The size of those fees in the Part D program has been growing in recent years. By one estimate, post-sale discounts accounted for 18 percent of all rebates and discounts collected by Part D plans in 2019. See Adam J.
