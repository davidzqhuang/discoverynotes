### The Profitability of Manufacturers of Brand-Name Drugs

Policymakers and stakeholders often express concern that the profits of manufacturers of brand-name drugs are excessive—particularly given the high and rising prices of many brand-name drugs and the budgetary pressures posed by rising health care costs. That concern may stem from the observation that brand-name prescription drugs are often priced at levels that greatly exceed the immediate costs of manufacturing and distributing them.[^1]

However, the profitability of pharmaceutical manufacturers depends on long-term comparisons of revenues versus spending—that is, spending for research and development (R&D) and for production of the firm’s entire portfolio of potential products. In general, studies that make those longer-range comparisons find that the profitability of the pharmaceutical industry is similar to that of other industries, whereas shorter-range comparisons find that the profitability of the pharmaceutical industry exceeds that of other industries.

### Factors Underlying the Profitability of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers

Understanding the profitability of the pharmaceutical industry requires distinguishing the revenues and short-run costs of producing a drug once it is approved from the much larger long-run costs of drug development and gaining approval for sale. Small-molecule brand-name drugs tend to have incremental production costs of just pennies per pill. Production costs are often higher for biological drugs, which might require more complex and costlier manufacturing processes. But those costs still tend to be low when compared with the prices that such brand-name prescription drugs often command. Meanwhile, the process of developing and testing a new drug and bringing it to market is risky, costly, and time-consuming.

Brand-name drugs generally command high prices once they are approved, because of the market power that manufacturers of brand-name drugs often have.[^2]

To encourage R&D, manufacturers of a brand-name drug are granted exclusive rights to produce and market that drug through a combination of patents (granted by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office) and exclusivity periods (set by statute, depending on the type of drug and the population it treats). Depending on factors such as the timing of a manufacturer’s patent application and how long a drug spends in clinical trials, those rights might be in force for a decade or more following the drug’s approval by the Food and Drug Administration. During that time, the manufacturer is the sole producer of that drug, although it may face competitive pressure if there are other, similar drugs available in the same therapeutic class. When the market-exclusivity period expires, other firms typically introduce generic versions of that drug, and those generic drugs are often sold at much lower prices than the brand-name drug. The period of exclusive sales rights can be highly profitable for the manufacturer, particularly when a drug confers substantial clinical benefits and few or no therapeutic alternatives are available.

However, from the firm’s perspective, profitability reflects its expenditures for all of the drugs in its portfolio of R&D activity, as well as its revenue streams and production costs for drugs that have reached the market. Decisions about whether to undertake the necessary laboratory research and clinical trials for any particular compound must be made in the face of uncertainty about its ultimate clinical value. Most drug compounds yield no significant therapeutic results; of those that enter clinical trials, only about 12 percent make it to market.
