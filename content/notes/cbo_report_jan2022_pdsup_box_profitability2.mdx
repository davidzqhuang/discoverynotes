### The Profitability of Manufacturers of Brand-Name Drugs, continued

So, for a firm with 100 products in development and 12 that make it to market, profitability depends on the revenues from the 12 marketed products and the cost of all 100 products in development. Even in those few cases in which a manufacturer successfully develops a new product, it sees no revenue for years following the various decisions about whether to proceed with the requisite stages of development.

Investment capital that is committed to drug R&D could have been invested instead in other activities that are less risky yet still profitable. Because of the relatively high risk of failure in drug development, investors in R&D for those drugs tend to require, in compensation, a high return on their investment if drug development is successful. The investment decisions of manufacturers of brand-name drugs are informed by that same mechanism. A recent report by the Congressional Budget Office found that both total spending on R&D by manufacturers of brand-name drugs and the fraction of their revenues devoted to spending on R&D have increased in recent years.[^4] Accordingly, the opportunity costs of that investment capital—the returns that could have been earned through other investments—are an important component of a manufacturer’s total costs and must be taken into account when measuring the company’s profitability over the long term.

### Estimates of Pharmaceutical Firms’ Profits

Estimating the long-term profits that manufacturers of brand-name drugs realize requires examining the entire life cycle of development of a portfolio of drugs and the sales of those drugs. In CBO’s assessment, those costs (including long-term capital costs) and revenues constitute the most comprehensive measures of profitability. Estimates of such measures present challenges, and the results can be sensitive to the methods used. Some analyses that have made such an adjustment have found that, compared with other industries, the pharmaceutical industry does not have unusually high profits. A pair of recent studies found that when capital costs and financial risks are taken into account, the pharmaceutical industry’s profits are close to—or just below—the middle of the distribution of all industries and might be trending downward.[^5]

Some estimates of the pharmaceutical industry’s profitability reflect profits earned during a specific period, such as a year or a quarter. Such estimates often indicate that profit margins are higher for manufacturers of brand-name drugs than they are for many other firms.[^6] An annual profit estimate provides a glimpse of a drug manufacturer’s performance during a given year, but because it does not reflect the long-term opportunity costs and risks associated with R&D investment choices, it does not provide a complete assessment of the profitability of that firm’s drug development activity. A full discussion of the profitability of the pharmaceutical industry is beyond the scope of this report.
