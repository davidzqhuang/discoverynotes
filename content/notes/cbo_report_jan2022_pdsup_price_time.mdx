# How Has the Average Price of a Prescription Changed Over Time?
The average price of a prescription has fallen in both the Medicare Part D and Medicaid programs in recent years:

From $57 in 2009 to $50 in 2018 in Medicare Part D
From $63 to $48 in Medicaid over that period.
Those decreases were largely driven by the increased use of generic drugs in those programs. The growing use of generic drugs has put downward pressure on the nationwide average price of a prescription in recent years as well.

Brand-name drugs, while accounting for a declining share of prescriptions, have experienced substantial growth in average prices. Over the 2009–2018 period, the average price of a prescription for a brand-name drug more than doubled in the Medicare Part D program and increased by 50 percent in Medicaid. Two key drivers of those increases were higher launch prices for new drugs and growth in the prices of individual drugs already on the market. The growing shift toward specialty drugs among new drug entrants was an important factor in the increased launch prices of new drugs. (Specialty drugs, which treat complex, chronic, or rare conditions—such as different types of cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, or multiple sclerosis—tend to be costly to manufacture, serve relatively small markets, and have high prices. They may also require special handling or patient monitoring.)

Federal policies have also played a role in the pricing patterns for brand-name drugs. For example, Medicaid’s statutory rebates create an incentive for manufacturers to negotiate higher prices for commercial insurers as well as higher marketwide launch prices. (However, those rebates also create an incentive for manufacturers to increase prices more slowly over time, which probably mitigates the effect of higher initial prices.) In addition, the increase in the share of overall drug spending that is covered by Medicare and Medicaid may dampen the pressure on manufacturers to restrain prices because patients are more willing to purchase high-priced drugs when they have less exposure to those prices.

Unlike prices for brand-name drugs, average prices for generic drugs have fallen in recent years. From 2009 to 2018, the average price of a prescription for a generic drug fell from $22 to $17 in Medicare Part D and from $27 to $23 in Medicaid. Although the federal government and nearly all of the states have pursued legal action against several generic drug manufacturers for price fixing and other anticompetitive behavior, prices have probably increased for only a minority of generic drugs that represent a relatively small share of spending on prescription drugs.
