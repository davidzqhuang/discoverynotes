# Prices for Brand-Name Drugs

Net prices for brand-name drugs reflect the competitive landscape for a given drug. In cases in which therapeutic alternatives are limited, the manufacturer tends to have greater leverage, particularly for drugs that offer larger benefits to patients than other treatment options. In those cases, manufacturers have considerable monopoly power to exercise, particularly given that insured patients often pay a small share of the total price of a brand-name drug and that plans may feel considerable pressure to cover those drugs in order to retain market share. Similarly, as employers make decisions about the generosity of their employment-based plans, they may feel pressure to provide coverage for such drugs in order to retain employees. In situations in which there are therapeutic alternatives, payers and PBMs tend to have greater leverage to negotiate for lower net prices. In those cases, net prices would probably be set lower—or grow more slowly—because manufacturers typically accept lower prices in exchange for greater formulary access (or reduced formulary access for their competitors).

Since 2008, Medicare and Medicaid have both experienced substantial increases in the prices they pay for brand-name drugs. For Medicare Part D, the average net price of a prescription for a brand-name drug (measured in 2018 dollars) more than doubled between 2009 and 2018, from $149 to $353. For Medicaid, the average net price increased by about 50 percent, from $147 to $218 (see Figure 5). Retail prices have increased even more dramatically. Between 2009 and 2018, the average retail price of a prescription for a brand-name drug in Medicare Part D more than tripled, from $175 to $547. For Medicaid, the average retail price more than doubled, from $262 to $584. (For more detail on the divergence between retail and net prices, see Box 2.)
