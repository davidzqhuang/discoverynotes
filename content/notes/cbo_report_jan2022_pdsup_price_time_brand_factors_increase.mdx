# Factors Underlying Rapid Increases in Prices for Brand-Name Drugs

Growth in average prices reflects a combination of several factors. For example, the composition of brand-name prescriptions that people fill has shifted from less expensive drugs toward more expensive drugs. One key factor in the shift toward more expensive drugs is that newer drugs tend to be more expensive than older drugs. In addition, prices for drugs already on the market tend to grow faster than inflation. Finally, federal policies influence manufacturers’ pricing strategies and lead to higher prices in certain circumstances.

## The Role of Launch Prices

Newer drugs are often launched at higher prices than those paid for drugs currently on the market. For example, in the Medicare Part D program, the average net price in 2015 for brand-name drugs that were launched after 2010 was nearly four times the average net price for brand-name drugs already on the market in 2010. And in 2017, the average net price for new drugs launched after 2015 was 12 times the average net price for brand-name drugs already on the market in 2015. As a result, the combination of take-up of new brand-name drugs and shifting from older brand-name drugs to generic alternatives has led to higher average prices for brand-name drugs.

The phenomenon of increasingly high launch prices for new drugs is partly driven by the rising number of specialty drugs. Specialty drugs tend to be more complex to develop and manufacture than nonspecialty drugs, and they generally have much higher prices because of the larger benefits to health and well-being that they tend to confer on their patients. In 2015, they accounted for 78 percent of spending on new drugs (launched after 2010) in Medicare Part D and 8 percent of prescriptions for new drugs. In 2017, specialty drugs accounted for 88 percent of that spending and 39 percent of prescriptions for new drugs (those launched after 2015).

Although prices for a given drug vary across payers, the rising influence of specialty drugs on spending—and therefore on usage-weighted average prices—probably plays a role for all payers. An industry report supports that idea, noting that specialty drugs represented the largest share of new drugs over the 2014–2018 period and that specialty drugs have “far higher” costs per patient than nonspecialty drugs.

## The Role of Price Growth

Another key component of the growth in average net prices for brand-name drugs is year-over-year price growth for a given drug, though the importance of that factor may differ substantially among payers. Using a price index approach, CBO found that net prices for brand-name drugs increased by an average of 6.3 percent per year from 2010 to 2017 in the Medicare Part D program, after removing the effects of general inflation. In contrast, using a similar approach, recent research on nationwide drug spending patterns found that nominal net prices (that is, net prices with no adjustments for inflation) for brand-name drugs grew by an average of only 3 percent per year over the 2012–2017 period. CBO estimates that nominal price growth for brand-name drugs in Medicare Part D was an average of 7.3 percent per year over the 2012–2017 period, although the two calculations are not directly comparable because they consist of somewhat different sets of drugs. In addition, the net prices in the nationwide study are net of all discounts along the supply chain—including discounts provided to distributors or directly to patients as well as rebates that payers received—whereas the net prices in CBO’s analysis account only for the rebates that payers received.

However, the large difference does suggest that prices paid by Part D over the 2012–2017 period grew more quickly than the prices paid by other payers, on average. That difference may have been driven by slower price growth in Medicaid, stemming from the statutory rebates that Medicaid receives. In addition, enrollees in commercial insurance plans may have been more likely to use drugs that face therapeutic competition than enrollees in Part D, which may have also led to slower growth in prices paid by commercial plans.

## The Role of Federal Policies

Federal policies may have contributed to the growth in drug prices. Medicaid is entitled to the largest rebate that a manufacturer provides to any payer. (That requirement does not apply to the rebates provided to certain government programs, such as Medicare Part D.) That probably has increased average net prices for commercial payers more broadly. Similarly, the additional statutory rebate provided to Medicaid for drugs whose retail prices rise faster than inflation may have contributed to the higher launch prices of new drugs. However, that rebate requirement may also have dampened price growth over time; as a result, average prices may have approached the level they would have without the policy.

Likewise, Medicare’s minimum formulary requirements may contribute to higher net drug prices in that program. In addition to the requirement that Part D plans cover all drugs in the six protected classes, plans are also required to cover at least two drugs in all other therapeutic classes. Those requirements diminish the leverage that PBMs bring to their negotiations with manufacturers over drug prices for Part D plans. Manufacturers may also feel less pressure to constrain prices because of the increase in the share of overall drug spending that is covered by insurers. That reduction in consumers’ exposure to high prices increases their willingness to purchase high-priced drugs. Manufacturers may interpret that phenomenon as a higher overall “willingness to pay” and set higher prices, or increase their prices faster, as a result. Policymakers and stakeholders have pointed to the high and rising prices of prescription drugs as a reason to question whether the profits of brand-name drug manufacturers are excessive.
