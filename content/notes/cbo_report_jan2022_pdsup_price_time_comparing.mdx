# Comparing Prices Among Payers

Underlying the overall trends are differences in the prices paid by various payers. (Payers are the entities that pay for prescription drugs, namely commercial insurers and federal health care programs, as well as individuals without prescription drug coverage.) One key factor that drives those differences is that manufacturers provide different rebate amounts to different payers for a given drug. Another key factor is that people with different sources of coverage tend to use different sets of drugs that have different average prices.
