## Comparisons With Commercial Plans

Although CBO does not have data on per capita drug use or average prices for the rest of the U.S. population, it is plausible that both average use and average retail prices for that group are between the Medicare and Medicaid averages. The average age of people without public insurance (most of whom have commercial insurance) and the average health status of that population are probably between those of the Medicaid population (which has a large proportion of younger parents and children) and the Medicare population (which consists mostly of elderly people and disabled people). In addition, the fact that the nationwide share of prescriptions for generic drugs is about the same as the share of such prescriptions in Medicare suggests that the generic share among commercially insured people is closer to Medicare’s percentage (90 percent) and higher than Medicaid’s percentage (87 percent).

Average net prices for commercial plans most likely differ from net prices in Medicare and Medicaid not only because of differences in the set of drugs those plans’ enrollees take but also because of differences in how those prices are determined. In CBO’s assessment, retail prices for a given drug are generally similar across payers. However, the net price of a given drug is generally lower for Medicaid than for commercial plans or for Medicare Part D because of rebates that manufacturers are required to pay to Medicaid plans—particularly for brand-name drugs. Medicaid programs are entitled by law to receive the greater of 23.1 percent of the drug’s average manufacturer price (AMP) or the largest rebate that the manufacturer gives to any payer (excluding certain government programs, such as Medicare Part D) for all brand-name drugs. The rebate also includes an additional component that is determined on the basis of growth in the drug’s AMP relative to inflation. For generic drugs, Medicaid’s rebate includes a basic rebate (equal to 13.0 percent of the drug’s AMP) and the same inflation-based component as Medicaid’s rebate for brand-name drugs.

In CBO’s judgment, the average net price of a given brand-name drug is probably lower in Medicare Part D than in commercial plans. The Medicare Part D benefit is administered by private insurers who also provide commercial insurance plans, and rebate negotiations by both types of plans are handled in similar fashion, perhaps even by the same negotiators. Those negotiations operate under the same general set of incentives for both Part D plans and private plans in that the availability of therapeutic alternatives—and a plan’s willingness to steer enrollees toward a particular drug—increases the amount that manufacturers are willing to provide to that plan in the form of a rebate.

The primary difference in bargaining leverage between commercial plans and Medicare Part D plans is that the largest rebate that a manufacturer offers to a commercial plan also has to be made available to Medicaid, which reduces the size of the largest rebate that manufacturers would otherwise be willing to pay. In contrast, rebates that manufacturers pay to Part D plans do not directly affect Medicaid prices. Therefore, manufacturers maybe willing to pay larger rebates to Part D plans than to commercial insurance plans.

However, another difference is that Part D plans must, by statute, cover all available drugs in each of six “protected” therapeutic classes. That puts Part D plans at a disadvantage when negotiating rebates on those drugs because their pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) cannot credibly threaten to exclude such drugs from the Part D formularies they manage if the manufacturer does not offer a sufficient rebate. (PBMs are intermediaries who manage prescription drug benefits for insurance plans or other payers.) Although there may be some variation in the extent of price differences for a given drug across therapeutic classes, CBO believes that the link between Medicaid’s “best price” requirements and the rebates paid to commercial plans outweighs the impact of the protected classes in Part D because the best price requirement applies to all brand-name drugs.
