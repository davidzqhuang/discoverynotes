## Comparisons Between Medicare and Medicaid

The similarity in the net prices for drugs covered by Medicare and Medicaid masks large differences in average retail prices—that is, the prices paid to pharmacies—for the drugs that beneficiaries of those programs purchase. The average retail price of a prescription covered by Medicaid is much higher than that of a prescription covered by Medicare. In 2018, that average price was $98 for Medicaid beneficiaries—about 40 percent higher than the average of $69 that Medicare beneficiaries incurred that year. Because retail prices for a given drug tend to be similar in Medicare and Medicaid, those differences primarily reflect differences in the mix of drugs used in the two programs.

The differences in average retail prices are most likely attributable to differences in the two populations’ underlying health care needs. Medicare beneficiaries tend to use less complex drugs that treat chronic conditions. Those drugs tend to have lower retail prices. By contrast, the prescriptions that Medicaid-only beneficiaries fill are more likely to be costly drugs that treat complex conditions. (Such drugs include psychotherapeutic drugs and HIV treatments.) Nevertheless, per enrollee spending on prescription drugs is lower in Medicaid than in Medicare because Medicaid beneficiaries tend to use fewer drugs. In addition, Medicaid beneficiaries tend to have low cost-sharing requirements—and sometimes none at all—and any cost sharing is generally not tied to the price of a drug. Therefore, Medicaid beneficiaries may be more likely to fill prescriptions for more expensive medications than Medicare beneficiaries, whose cost sharing is more directly tied to the price of a drug.

Another CBO report indicated that Medicare beneficiaries tend to use less expensive drugs within a therapeutic class than do Medicaid beneficiaries. Medicare beneficiaries also tend to use generic drugs to a slightly greater degree than Medicaid beneficiaries do. The remaining difference in retail prices stems from differences in average prices for the sets of brand-name and generic drugs used by the two populations.
