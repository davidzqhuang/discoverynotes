# Prices of Generic Drugs

The availability of therapeutic substitutes provides insurance plans and PBMs with leverage to negotiate lower prices. When alternatives are limited, such as when a new drug is the first to treat a particular condition, then insurance plans and PBMs have limited leverage to negotiate lower prices. As competing products enter the market, payers gain the flexibility to exclude a given drug or to limit patients’ use of that drug through higher cost sharing or other utilization management tools.

Consolidation within the pharmacy-benefit-management industry has also increased the leverage that PBMs wield in negotiating on behalf of their client insurers. In the 1980s, the industry consisted of many small PBMs, which, for the most part, simply processed pharmacy claims. Since then, the industry has evolved and now develops and administers many insurance plans’ drug formularies. In addition, the PBM industry has come to be dominated by just a few large firms. A 2015 merger between the third- and fourth-largest firms left the three largest PBMs handling more than 70 percent of the industry’s prescription drug claims. That market power helps those large PBMs negotiate bigger rebates and steeper discounts because they represent a larger share of the patient population. However, their market power remains limited when negotiating net prices of drugs without direct substitutes.

Nevertheless, greater consolidation within the PBM industry also has implications for plans’ costs. For example, PBMs probably use their increased leverage when negotiating with insurance plans over contract terms to charge higher fees to plans (which could take the form of PBMs keeping a larger fraction of rebates). The insurance plans then pass some share of those higher costs on to consumers in the form of higher premiums. In addition, over time, there has been an increase in consolidation between PBMs and insurers, as well as between PBMs and pharmacies, including mail-order and specialty pharmacies. Although that type of consolidation can increase efficiency and reduce plans’ costs, the extent to which reduced costs are passed on to enrollees depends on the amount of competition in the market. In addition, to the extent that insurers, PBMs, and pharmacies negotiate with entities outside their ownership group, there may be an incentive to charge higher fees to rival companies.
