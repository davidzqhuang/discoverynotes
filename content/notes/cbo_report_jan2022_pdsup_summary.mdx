Prescription drugs have become an increasingly important part of U.S. health care, as evidenced by the growth in nationwide spending on those drugs from 1980 to 2018.1
Over that period, such spending increased more than tenfold in real terms (that is, with the effects of economywide inflation excluded). This report by the Congressional Budget Office discusses trends in nationwide spending on prescription drugs in the retail market from 1980 to 2018. It also presents a detailed analysis of trends in spending, use, and prices in the Medicare Part D and Medicaid programs over the 2009â€“2018 period.
