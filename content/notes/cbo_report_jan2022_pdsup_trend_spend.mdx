# Recent Trends in Spending for Prescription Drugs

Nationwide spending on prescription drugs increased substantially from $30 billion in 1980 to $335 billion in 2018 (all estimates in 2018 dollars). Over this period, real per capita spending on prescription drugs increased more than sevenfold, rising from $140 to $1,073.20.

## Drivers of Increase in Spending
The significant increase in spending was driven by the development and utilization of various drugs, resulting in numerous health benefits:

- **Health Benefit-Related Drugs**: Some drugs, like those treating cardiovascular conditions, are associated with reduced spending on services provided by hospitals and physicians due to their health benefits.
  
- **Life-Improving Drugs**: Drugs for chronic conditions like multiple sclerosis or cancer might not offer compensatory savings but have improved the lives of chronic patients and extended life expectancies.

## Trends in Spending Growth
Spending on prescription drugs witnessed a rapid increase after the mid-1990s due to the introduction of several “blockbuster” drugs—those generating at least $1 billion in annual sales. These drugs typically treat widespread conditions like high cholesterol or high blood pressure.

There was a notable increase in spending between 2013 and 2015, followed by slower growth since the mid-2000s. The slowing growth—and resulting reduction in per capita spending—is attributed to the growing availability of lower-priced generic drugs. The spike in spending between 2013 and 2015 coincided with the introduction of an expensive class of drugs for hepatitis C treatment.

## Medicare and Medicaid Spending
- **Medicare Part D**: Per enrollee spending in Medicare Part D was fairly stable from 2009 to 2018, averaging about $2,700 per year.

- **Medicaid**: Annual per enrollee spending in Medicaid increased by 20 percent over the same period, from $445 to $530, whereas nationwide per capita spending rose by 10 percent.

### Factors Influencing Spending Differences
- **Patient Health Profiles**: The health profiles of enrollees in Medicare, Medicaid, and the nation vary, influencing average spending. Medicare beneficiaries are often prescribed medications for chronic conditions, while many Medicaid beneficiaries are younger, healthier, and less likely to have ongoing prescriptions.

- **Statutory Rebates**: Medicaid's statutory rebates, or payments from drug manufacturers to payers (including health insurance plans and Medicaid), also play a role in spending differences.
