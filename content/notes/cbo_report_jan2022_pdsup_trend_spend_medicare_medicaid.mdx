# Medicare and Medicaid Spending on Prescription Drugs

Measured in 2018 dollars, spending on prescription drugs grew from $74 billion in 2009 to $120 billion in 2018 in the Medicare Part D program and from $18 billion to $32 billion in Medicaid. Those programs account for a large share of all U.S. spending on retail prescription drugs. Together, beneficiaries in those programs were responsible for about 45 percent of nationwide spending on retail prescription drugs in 2018 as measured in the National Health Expenditure Accounts.

The analysis in this section covers a shorter period than the period examined for nationwide spending because Medicare Part D was not implemented until 2006, and early data were not representative of the program’s spending because it took time for enrollees to adapt to the new program. This was particularly true for people who were dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid and whose prescription drug coverage transitioned from Medicaid to Medicare Part D. CBO therefore decided to focus on the most recent 10-year period for which data were available for both programs. (Those totals reflect amounts spent by insurers and patients, less rebates and discounts for brand-name drugs.)

For the purposes of making comparisons between different populations, it is most meaningful to compare patterns in per capita or per enrollee spending. Changes in spending per person reflect a variety of factors, such as changes in average health status—both at the population level and the program level—and changes in prices. For example, the aging of members of the baby-boom generation most likely increased nationwide per capita spending over the 2009–2018 period because of the corresponding increase in the average age of the population. At the same time, that trend probably put downward pressure on per enrollee spending in Medicare Part D because it corresponded to a larger relative increase in the younger Medicare population. Changes in total spending are also affected by population and enrollment growth—and enrollment in Medicare Part D and Medicaid grew much faster than the nationwide population over the study period.

For Medicare Part D, net per enrollee spending on prescription drugs remained relatively stable, averaging about $2,700 from 2009 to 2018. Medicaid’s per enrollee spending grew by about 20 percent over that period, starting from $445 per enrollee in 2009 and reaching $530 in 2018. Over the same period, nationwide per capita spending grew by nearly 10 percent—from $957 to $1,073.

The greater increase in Medicaid’s per enrollee spending may partly relate to new specialty drugs that treat conditions, such as HIV or hepatitis C, with a higher prevalence in the Medicaid population than in the Part D population. Another key factor is a greater increase in per enrollee use of prescription drugs in Medicaid than in Medicare Part D, as demonstrated below. The role of the Medicaid expansions in those trends is unclear, depending on the average usage patterns of the newly eligible Medicaid population compared with the previously eligible population. One study found that increases in prescription volume were similar to increases in enrollment in states that expanded Medicaid, suggesting that the impact on per enrollee spending depends on the average prices for drugs used by the newly eligible population compared with the previously eligible population.

Differences in the amounts of per enrollee spending in Medicare Part D and Medicaid and in per capita spending in the United States as a whole are stark. They are most likely driven by a combination of differences in average health status and statutory rebates in the Medicaid program. Per enrollee spending in Medicare is much higher than the national average, probably because many Medicare beneficiaries have chronic health conditions and may fill several prescriptions per month. By contrast, lower per enrollee spending in Medicaid is probably attributable to a combination of the statutory rebates in that program—which lead to lower net prices—and the fact that many Medicaid beneficiaries with prescription drug coverage are relatively healthy adults or children. That offsets higher average spending by the less healthy disabled population in the Medicaid program.
