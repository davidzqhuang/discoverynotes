# Nationwide Spending on Prescription Drugs

Since 1980, the share of nationwide spending on health care services overall that can be attributed to prescription drugs has nearly doubled, from about 5 percent to almost 10 percent in 2018. Through the 1980s and early 1990s, 5 percent to 6 percent of all spending on health care services and supplies was on prescription drugs obtained in the retail market (that is, from pharmacies—either in stores or by mail order). By 2018, that share was 10 percent (see Figure 1). In comparison, the share of spending on health care services and supplies that was attributable to hospital services fell from 40 percent in 1980 to 31 percent in 2018, and the share attributable to services provided by medical professionals and in clinical settings was about 20 percent over that period.

Nationwide per capita spending on prescription drugs increased from $140 in 1980 to $1,073 in 2018 (see Figure 2).5 (Those spending amounts are net of rebates and discounts. For background information on rebates, negotiations, and other attributes of pharmaceutical markets, see Box 1 on page 6.) Per capita spending on prescription drugs roughly doubled every 10 years before slowing down in the mid-2000s.

Although this report focuses on prescription drugs obtained through the retail market, spending on prescription drugs purchased in nonretail settings—such as physicians’ offices, clinics, and hospitals—represents a substantial share of overall spending on prescription drugs. A recent estimate suggests that nonretail drugs represented approximately 30 percent of overall net spending on prescription drugs in the United States in 2016.6 The general pattern of total drug spending over the period studied in this report is similar when those other sources and types of prescription drugs are included.

## Trends in Spending Over the 1995–2013 Period

Spending on prescription drugs rose particularly rapidly after 1995 as a number of drugs reached blockbuster status. That wave of blockbuster drugs consisted of top sellers that were in high demand because they offered new treatments for relatively common health conditions. The most prominent of those drugs were statins for high cholesterol, ACE inhibitors for high blood pressure, proton-pump inhibitors for acid reflux and gastric ulcers, and antidepressants and antipsychotics for mental illnesses. When the patents on those drugs began to expire—an event often referred to as the patent cliff—lower-priced generic substitutes were introduced and gained market share. In the midst of that shift, the Medicare Part D program was created, which both increased access to prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries and contributed to the shift from brand-name drugs to generic alternatives. As a result, per capita spending on prescription drugs leveled off at about $940 in the mid-2000s and then fell to $900 by 2013, and the share of overall health care spending for prescription drugs peaked at 10.5 percent in 2006 and then fell to 9.2 percent in 2013.

## Trends in Spending Since 2013

Spending on prescription drugs increased again over the 2013–2015 period before leveling off thereafter. A key factor in that increase was the introduction, at the end of 2013, of a class of specialty drugs that treat hepatitis C. The drugs for hepatitis C were introduced at particularly high prices. Insurers and patients may have been willing to pay those prices because of the enormous clinical benefits those drugs offer when compared with older therapies (they successfully treat about 95 percent of patients with chronic hepatitis C infection) and the stiff demand for that kind of therapy. However, the patient population for that class of drugs is larger than that for many specialty drugs, leading to a larger impact on spending than would have occurred for a similarly priced drug that treats a smaller patient population. Implementation of the insurance expansions under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) also occurred during this period. Researchers have found that new take-up of Medicaid in states that expanded coverage under the terms of the ACA was associated with greater use of prescription drugs because those benefits reduced out-of-pocket spending for the previously uninsured and also tended to be more generous than previous sources of coverage. Take-up of marketplace health insurance options under the insurance expansions may have been associated with a similar response. However, overall use of prescriptions in the Medicaid program did not grow faster in the years immediately following the insurance expansions than it did in prior years, suggesting that the expansions were not a key driver of the increase in spending on prescription drugs over that period.
