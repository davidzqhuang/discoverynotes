# Trends in Spending for Prescription Drugs
From 1980 until the mid-2000s, spending on prescription drugs increased steadily—both in dollar terms and
as a share of overall health care spending. That growth
was driven by increases in the availability and use of
different types of new drug therapies along with increasing prices of brand-name drugs. However, after the
mid-2000s, the increasing availability and use of generic
drugs put downward pressure on spending growth.
Nationwide, real per capita spending and the share of
overall health care spending attributable to prescription
drugs began to decrease in the mid-2000s, with the
exception of a sharp increase from 2013 to 2015. That
increase coincided with the introduction of a particularly
expensive class of drugs that are used to treat hepatitis C.
Per enrollee spending was relatively flat in the Medicare
Part D program from 2009 to 2018, whereas Medicaid’s
per enrollee drug spending grew over that period.
