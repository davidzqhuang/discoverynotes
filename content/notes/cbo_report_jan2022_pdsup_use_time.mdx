## How Has the Use of Prescription Drugs Changed Over Time?

Nationwide per capita use of prescription drugs has increased in recent years. Per enrollee use of prescription drugs has also increased in Medicare Part D and Medicaidâ€”from an average of 48 prescriptions per year in 2009 to 54 in 2018 in Medicare Part D, and from 7 prescriptions per year to 11 in Medicaid over that period. Increased use of prescription drugs is primarily associated with the increasing availability and use of generic drugs, along with the continued development of new treatments. In addition, the share of spending on prescription drugs that insurers cover has increased substantially: In 1990, consumers paid 57 percent of their prescription drug costs out of pocket, on average. By 2009, that share had fallen to 20 percent; it fell further, to 15 percent, in 2018.

The share of prescriptions for generic drugs has also increased substantially. Nationwide, that share increased from 75 percent in 2009 to 90 percent in 2018. In Medicare Part D, the share of prescriptions for generic drugs increased from 72 percent to 90 percent between 2009 and 2018; in Medicaid, it increased from 70 percent to 87 percent over that period. Increased use of generic drugs is attributable to several factors: their growing availability; their lower prices; and the lower out-of-pocket liability for consumers with health insurance compared with the amount people would pay for brand-name drugs. The share of prescriptions for generic drugs may be less likely to rise in the future, both because the 90 percent dispensing rate for such drugs is already high and because newer brand-name drugs tend to be more costly to manufacture and may be more challenging to replicate as generic drugs.
