## Underlying Drivers of Increased Use

The reduction in consumers’ out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs is one key factor that explains the increased use of prescription drugs. In 1990, consumers’ share of spending on prescription drugs was 57 percent. By 2009, that share had fallen to 20 percent. It continued to fall thereafter, declining to 15 percent in 2018. That long-term decline is largely explained by a gradual increase in the share of spending covered by the Medicare and Medicaid programs, which grew from 13 percent in 1990 to 36 percent in 2018.23

Some of that increase is attributable to the creation of Medicare Part D in 2006. In that year, the share of spending covered by Medicare and Medicaid increased to 25 percent, up from 19 percent in 2005. That share has steadily increased since 2006. More recent increases were partly attributable to the increased generosity of the Part D benefit that was mandated by both the ACA in 2010 and the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, as well as to the Medicaid expansions that were encouraged by the ACA.24

The role of private health insurance in paying for prescription drugs has also increased since 1990. Its share of spending was 26 percent in 1990 and 44 percent in 2018, although the share covered by private health insurance was highest in the early 2000s, ranging from 47 percent to 50 percent. That share has since fallen.

Greater access to generic drugs in those programs may be another key factor that explains the increased use of prescription drugs: Lower-cost options make it easier for people to purchase their prescribed medications. Nationwide, the share of standardized prescriptions dispensed for generic drugs was 75 percent in 2009 and reached 90 percent by 2018.25 In Medicare Part D, the number of standardized prescriptions dispensed for generic drugs more than doubled from 2009 through 2018, whereas the number of standardized prescriptions dispensed for brand-name drugs declined by a third. In Medicaid, the number of generic prescriptions roughly tripled over that time, whereas the number of brand-name prescriptions was essentially unchanged (see Figure 3). As a result, the share of prescriptions for generic drugs in Medicare Part D increased from 72 percent in 2009 to 90 percent in 2018; that share increased from 70 percent to 87 percent in Medicaid over the same period. Increased use of generic drugs also helps explain why per enrollee spending in federal programs rose more slowly than the increase in overall use of prescription drugs in those programs.
