## Factors Contributing to Changes in the Use of Generic Drugs

One of the primary factors contributing to the increased use of generic drugs over the 2009â€“2018 period was the availability of generic equivalents for a growing number of brand-name drugs as their patents expired or were successfully challenged by manufacturers of generic drugs. That process accelerated in the first decade of the 2000s when the blockbuster drugs of the previous decade began losing their sales-exclusivity rights. In addition, insurers have used a variety of tools to steer patients toward generic drugs.

However, the rate of increase in the share of prescriptions for generic drugs has slowed in recent years. That reduced growth coincides with the leveling off of two former sources of growth: First, the share of prescriptions for which a generic option is available has equaled 92 percent since 2016. Second, since 2013, 97 percent of prescriptions that have both a brand-name option and a generic option have been dispensed as generic drugs.

Also, going forward, further availability of generic drugs may be somewhat limited if newer and more complex brand-name drugs are less likely to attract generic competition. That could be the case if those drugs treat conditions that affect fewer patients and are more challenging to replicate.
