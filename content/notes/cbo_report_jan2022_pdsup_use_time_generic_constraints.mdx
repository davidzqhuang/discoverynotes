The use of generic drugs may not increase much further for two reasons:

1. **Extensive Usage**: Generic drugs are used extensively, representing 90 percent of all prescriptions.

2. **Complexity of Newer Drugs**: Newer drugs are more likely to be biologics (drugs produced from living organisms), which are more complex and harder to manufacture or replicate than small-molecule drugs. Consequently, there may be fewer generics developed from them when their patents expire.

Manufacturing a biologic with the same active molecule—called a biosimilar—introduces an additional layer of complexity compared with small-molecule drugs. Biosimilars are necessarily created from different cell lines than the originals, so they are not identical at the molecular level. As a result—unlike for generic versions of small-molecule drugs—noninnovator firms (that is, manufacturers of generic or biosimilar drugs) typically need to run clinical trials to demonstrate that their biosimilars are not meaningfully different from the reference biologic product.

For certain biologic drugs that have small markets, the difficulty that prospective imitators might face is compounded. The lower potential revenues from sharing a small market, at lower prices, may increase the risk that firms producing biosimilars will fail to recover their higher development costs from imitating a complex drug. As a result, future competition from noninnovators may be less robust in some cases as the patents for today's newer drugs expire.

In addition, drug manufacturers have been able to partly neutralize insurance plans' ability to steer their enrollees toward generic drugs by issuing coupons directly to consumers. Drug coupons make expensive therapies more affordable and increase manufacturers' unit sales. However, coupons interfere with insurers' cost-control efforts: Specifically, by covering some or all of an enrollee's copayment or coinsurance (cost sharing in the form of a set percentage of the drug's cost), coupons reduce or eliminate the cost difference between a more expensive drug and a cheaper generic or preferred alternative.

When a coupon induces an enrollee to choose a brand-name drug over a generic, it increases the cost to insurers because they then must cover the more expensive brand-name drug for that enrollee. (Coupons also provide a discount for consumers who have not yet met their deductible or who lack insurance coverage.)

Coupon programs offered by manufacturers have become more prevalent over time: Whereas in 2009 manufacturers issued coupons for fewer than 100 brand-name drugs, by 2015 more than 700 drugs were covered by coupons. Some policymakers have taken steps to limit the use of those coupons. For example, California has banned their use for brand-name drugs that have generic equivalents. By one estimate, that ban affects about 20 percent of the drugs covered by coupons. Other states are considering similar legislation. In addition, coupons for brand-name drugs cannot be used by Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries because they constitute a violation of the anti-kickback statute.
