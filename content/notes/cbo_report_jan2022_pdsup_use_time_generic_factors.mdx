## Factors that Increase the Use of Generic Drugs

Health insurers use a variety of methods to encourage the use of generic drugs when they are available. A common tool is to charge lower out-of-pocket costs for generics than for brand-name alternatives. For example, employment-based insurance plans required a copayment—that is, a specified dollar amount that an enrollee pays at the time a drug is purchased—of $11, on average, in 2019 for prescription drugs in their first tier, which is usually largely restricted to generic drugs.[^27] Average copayments for drugs in the second and third tiers ranged from $33 to $59; those tiers tend to include preferred and nonpreferred brand-name drugs.[^28] Plans often require lower cost sharing for drugs with “preferred” formulary placement and higher cost sharing for drugs with “nonpreferred” formulary placement. (A formulary is the plan’s list of covered prescription drugs.) Plans typically require even higher cost sharing for specialty drugs, which are less likely to have generic alternatives.

Similarly, median copayments for generic drugs ranged from no cost for preferred generics to $3 for nonpreferred generics among stand-alone Medicare Part D plans in 2020. (The median copayment divides copayment amounts into two equal groups; that is, half of enrollees in stand-alone Part D plans paid nothing for preferred generics and no more than $3 for nonpreferred generics, and the other half paid no less than those amounts.) Copayments for generic drugs topped out at $10 that year, and the median copayment for preferred brand-name drugs was $42.[^29] In general, cost sharing for nonpreferred brand-name drugs and specialty drugs tended to be set at a percentage of retail prices—the prices that plans pay to pharmacies, which do not account for rebates provided by manufacturers.[^30]

Other tools are used to manage utilization directly: For the most part, the Medicaid program requires that generic versions of a drug be dispensed when available, and most Medicare Part D plans exclude the brand-name version of a drug from its formulary when a generic alternative is available.[^31]

When consumers pay the full amount for a prescription drug out of pocket, the difference in the amount they pay for a generic drug versus a brand-name alternative is generally larger than the differences described above. That leads to a greater incentive to choose a generic substitute over a brand-name drug. Consumers may have to pay the full amount for a drug for three reasons: They lack health insurance (or their plan does not include coverage for prescription drugs); their prescribed drug is not covered by their plan; or they have not met their insurance plan’s annual deductible (if any) for prescription drugs. (A deductible is the amount of spending an enrollee incurs before an insurer begins covering expenses.) In the first two cases, consumers may pay a pharmacy’s “usual and customary” price—which tends to be higher than the retail prices paid by other federal health care programs and commercial insurers—or they may pay a discounted amount using a coupon program such as GoodRx.[^32] In the third case, the consumer pays the retail price that the plan negotiated with the pharmacy. In 2019, 13 percent of people with employment-based insurance were enrolled in a plan with a deductible specific to prescription drugs, up from 10 percent in 2005.[^33]
