# Trends in the Use of Prescription Drugs Overview

Utilization of prescription drugs nationwide has increased in recent years, both because the prevalence of chronic conditions has increased with the aging of the U.S. population and because new therapies and generic drugs have become available.22 Over the past several decades, consumers, health care providers, and insurers have witnessed the emergence of blockbuster therapies that treat common conditions, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, anxiety, and depression; and the emergence of generic alternatives for those drugs has improved access to such treatments by offering lower-cost options. In addition, consumers’ share of spending on prescription drugs has fallen substantially as the combined share of spending covered by federal programs and private health insurance has increased over time.

Use of prescription drugs among those enrolled in Medicare Part D and Medicaid increased as well. Administrative data about Medicare Part D show that from 2009 to 2018 the average number of standardized prescriptions per beneficiary rose from 48 to 54 per year—a 13 percent increase. (Standardized prescriptions are adjusted to 30-day equivalents for more than a 30-day supply.) According to administrative data about Medicaid, the number of prescriptions per person with Medicaid coverage for prescription drugs rose from an average of 7 to 11 per year over that same period—an increase of 57 percent. (The administrative data on Medicaid drug use and spending do not include information on days supplied and thus are unadjusted.)

As with per enrollee spending, the variation in per enrollee use of prescription drugs between those two programs reflects differences in the health status of their beneficiaries.
