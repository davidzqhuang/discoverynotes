## Step 1

Discovery and Development: Step 1 involves the discovery and development of potential new drugs. Initially, researchers explore various avenues like understanding disease processes, testing multiple compounds, observing effects of existing treatments, and employing new technologies to discover promising drug candidates. Thousands of compounds may be considered initially, but only a few promising ones are selected for further development. In the development stage, detailed experiments are conducted on these selected compounds to understand their pharmacokinetics, potential benefits, optimal dosages, administration methods, side effects, interactions with other drugs, and effectiveness compared to similar drugs.

## Step 2

Preclinical Testing: Step 2 focuses on preclinical testing to evaluate a drug's potential toxicity before it is tested on humans. This phase consists of two types of preclinical research: In Vitro and In Vivo studies. Researchers must adhere to Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) as required by the FDA, following strict guidelines and regulations to ensure the quality and safety of the studies. Though preclinical studies are relatively small, they provide crucial information regarding dosing and toxicity levels of the drug candidate. The results of these studies determine whether the drug should proceed to testing in humans.

## Step 3

While preclinical research answers basic questions about a drug’s safety, it is not a substitute for studies of ways the drug will interact with the human body. “Clinical research” refers to studies, or trials, that are done in people. As the developers design the clinical study, they will consider what they want to accomplish for each of the different Clinical Research Phases and begin the Investigational New Drug Process (IND), a process they must go through before clinical research begins.

## Step 4

If a drug developer has evidence from its early tests and preclinical and clinical research that a drug is safe and effective for its intended use, the company can file an application to market the drug. The FDA review team thoroughly examines all submitted data on the drug and makes a decision to approve or not to approve it.

## Step 5

Even though clinical trials provide important information on a drug’s efficacy and safety, it is impossible to have complete information about the safety of a drug at the time of approval. Despite the rigorous steps in the process of drug development, limitations exist. Therefore, the true picture of a product’s safety actually evolves over the months and even years that make up a product’s lifetime in the marketplace. FDA reviews reports of problems with prescription and over-the-counter drugs, and can decide to add cautions to the dosage or usage information, as well as other measures for more serious issues.
