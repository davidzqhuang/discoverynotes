# The Drug Development Process, Step 2: Preclinical Research

Before testing a drug in people, researchers must determine whether it has the potential to cause serious harm, also known as toxicity. The preclinical research phase is crucial for this determination, and it consists of two types:

- **In Vitro**
- **In Vivo**

### Good Laboratory Practices (GLP)
The FDA mandates researchers to adhere to Good Laboratory Practices (GLP), as outlined in medical product development regulations for preclinical laboratory studies. The GLP regulations can be located in [21 CFR Part 58.1: Good Laboratory Practice for Nonclinical Laboratory Studies](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?CFRPart=58&showFR=1).

GLP regulations establish the basic minimum requirements for various aspects of the studies, including:

- Study conduct
- Personnel
- Facilities
- Equipment
- Written protocols
- Operating procedures
- Study reports
- System of quality assurance oversight

### Preclinical Studies Overview
Although usually not extensive, preclinical studies need to yield detailed information on dosing and toxicity levels. After this phase, researchers will review the findings and make a decision on whether to advance to testing the drug in people.
