# The Drug Development Process, Step 3: Clinical Research and Drug Development Process

While preclinical research answers basic questions about a drug’s safety, it doesn't substitute for studies exploring the drug's interaction with the human body. “Clinical research” refers to trials conducted in people. Developers must consider their goals for each Clinical Research Phase and initiate the **Investigational New Drug Process (IND)** before clinical research begins.

## Designing Clinical Trials

Clinical trials are designed to answer specific questions related to a medical product. The design process involves:

- **Selection Criteria**: Determining who qualifies to participate.
- **Study Size**: Deciding the number of participants.
- **Study Duration**: Establishing how long the study will last.
- **Control Group**: Implementing control groups and other methods to limit research bias.
- **Dosage**: Defining how the drug will be administered and at what dosage.
- **Assessments**: Planning assessments, data collection, and review procedures.

Clinical trials typically proceed from small-scale Phase 1 to large-scale Phase 3 studies.

## Clinical Research Phase Studies

### Phase 1
- **Participants**: 20 to 100 volunteers.
- **Duration**: Several months.
- **Purpose**: Safety and dosage.
- Approximately 70% of drugs proceed to Phase 2.

### Phase 2
- **Participants**: Up to several hundred.
- **Duration**: Several months to 2 years.
- **Purpose**: Efficacy and side effects.
- Approximately 33% of drugs proceed to Phase 3.

### Phase 3
- **Participants**: 300 to 3,000 volunteers.
- **Duration**: 1 to 4 years.
- **Purpose**: Efficacy and adverse reactions monitoring.
- 25-30% of drugs proceed to Phase 4.

### Phase 4
- **Participants**: Several thousand volunteers.
- **Purpose**: Safety and efficacy.

## The Investigational New Drug Process

Developers must submit an **Investigational New Drug (IND) application** to the FDA, including:

- Animal study and toxicity data.
- Manufacturing information.
- Clinical protocols for planned studies.
- Data from prior human research.
- Information about the investigator.

## Asking for FDA Assistance

Developers can seek FDA assistance at any stage, including:

- Pre-IND application.
- After Phase 2 for guidance on large Phase 3 study design.
- Any time for IND application assessment.

While the FDA provides technical assistance, adherence to their suggestions is not mandatory.

## FDA IND Review Team

The team comprises specialists in various fields, each with specific responsibilities:

- **Project Manager**: Coordinates the review process.
- **Medical Officer**: Reviews clinical study data.
- **Statistician**: Interprets clinical trial designs and data.
- **Pharmacologist**: Reviews preclinical studies.
- **Pharmakineticist**: Focuses on the drug’s processes and interprets clinical trial data.
- **Chemist**: Evaluates the drug’s chemical compounds.
- **Microbiologist**: Assesses antimicrobial products.

## Approval

The FDA review team takes 30 days to review the IND submission. Responses to IND applications can be:

- Approval to begin trials.
- Clinical hold for various reasons, including significant risk, unqualified investigators, or insufficient trial risk information.

Clinical holds are rare; the FDA often suggests improvements. If federal standards are met, trials usually proceed. Developers must keep the review team informed about new protocols and serious side effects. After trials, study reports must be submitted. The process continues until clinical trials end or a marketing application is filed. Developers need data from two large, controlled trials before filing a marketing application.
