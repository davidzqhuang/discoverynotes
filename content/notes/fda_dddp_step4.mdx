# The Drug Development Process, Step 4: Drug Approval Process

## Introduction

If a drug developer possesses evidence from early tests, preclinical, and clinical research indicating a drug is safe and effective for its intended use, they can file an application to market the drug. The FDA review team scrutinizes all data submitted on the drug to decide whether to approve it or not.

## New Drug Application (NDA)

An NDA is a comprehensive document providing a drug's full story, aimed at demonstrating its safety and effectiveness for its intended use in the studied population. It includes:

* Preclinical data to Phase 3 trial data
* Reports on all studies, data, and analyses
* Clinical results
* Proposed labeling
* Safety updates
* Drug abuse information
* Patent information
* Data from studies conducted outside the United States
* Institutional review board compliance information
* Directions for use

## FDA Review

Upon receiving an NDA, the FDA review team assesses its completeness. If incomplete, the NDA can be refused; if complete, the team has 6 to 10 months to decide on the drug’s approval. The process involves:

* Individual reviews by each team member of their assigned application section (e.g., medical officers review clinical data, pharmacologists review animal study data).
* Supervisory reviews within each technical discipline.
* FDA inspectors visit clinical study sites to check for data fabrication, manipulation, or withholding.
* Compilation of individual reviews and documents, like inspection reports, into an “action package” serving as the FDA review record.
* Issuance of a recommendation by the review team, with the final decision made by a senior FDA official.

## FDA Approval

After deeming a drug safe and effective, FDA collaborates with the applicant to refine prescribing information, or “labeling”, which describes the approval basis and optimal drug use. However, some issues might need resolution before marketing approval. The FDA might require additional data analysis or studies, and the developer can decide whether to proceed with development. Developers can formally appeal against FDA decisions if they disagree.

## FDA Advisory Committees

For NDAs with adequate safety and effectiveness data, FDA can usually make decisions without external input. However, when additional considerations are necessary, FDA might convene an Advisory Committee meeting for expert advice and public comment. These committees include a Patient Representative providing patient perspective input.
