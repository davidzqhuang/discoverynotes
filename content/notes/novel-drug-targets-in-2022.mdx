In 2022, the number of novel drugs approved in the USA, European Union and Japan declined, dropping from ~60 in recent years to 48. Of these, 35 have well-established mechanism-of-action (MoA) targets (Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 16, 19–34; 2017) as described in package inserts and primary literature. Here, we focus on the 12 drugs approved in 2022 with novel MoA targets (Table 1). These targets have not been modulated by any previously approved drug.

Five targets, representing diverse protein classes, are modulated by small molecules. Notably, novel targets emerged in stagnant areas, such as β-cardiac myosin 7 (MYH7) for cardiomyopathy and P2X purinoceptor 3 (P2RX3) for chronic cough. Pimitespib, licensed in Japan, is the first specific heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) inhibitor. Lenacapavir, the sole drug on the list targeting a non-human protein, inhibits the HIV-1 viral capsid.

Four targets are inhibited by monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Two mAbs, spesolimab and nemolizumab, target interleukin receptors (IL-36R and IL-31RA) for psoriasis and atopic dermatitis treatment, respectively. Sutimlimab treats autoimmune haemolytic anaemia by inhibiting the complement pathways via C1s. Relatlimab, the first lymphocyte activation gene 3 (LAG3) blocker, enhances the anti-tumour activity of PD1 inhibition in melanoma.

Tebentafusp, a bispecific fusion protein, redirects T cells to target melanoma cells that express glycoprotein 100 (gp100). This is accomplished by combining a T cell receptor that binds to a gp100 peptide–human leukocyte antigen (HLA)‐A*02:01 complex on melanocytes with an antibody fragment that binds to CD3 on T cells. Faricimab, a bispecific antibody, targets angiopoietin 2 (ANGPT2) and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) for retinal vascular disease treatment.

Tirzepatide, the only peptide drug to be approved in 2022, improves glycaemic control by activating two G-protein-coupled receptors: a novel drug target, the glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor (GIPR), and the glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP1) receptor, which is an established target of drugs for diabetes and obesity.

As for therapeutic areas, half of the novel targets are modulated by drugs that treat rare diseases of the blood, heart, skin or eye.
