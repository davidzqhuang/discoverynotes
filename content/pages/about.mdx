description: The goal of DiscoveryNotes is to use AI as a Librarian to access Knowledge on the durg discovery and development process.

Overall Architecture: We and the AI collectively maintain a tree of notes which the AI traverses to retrieve information and answer question. We need to contribute quality information sources and we need to help organize the data and guide the AI's interpretation in the data. We need to always track the provenance of the information.

I guess this is technically Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) but that isn't the point.
