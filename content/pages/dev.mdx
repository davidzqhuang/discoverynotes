## Dev Roadmap (as of 10/4/2023):

    - Exploring in [User Persona Doc](/personas)
3. Get in MVP notes 
4. Make demo
5. Make readme

## Dev Roadmap (as of 10/2/2023):

1. ✅ Basic repository set up
2. ✅ Chat window design with notes dialog
3. ✅ Chat interaction
4. Inject notes, ✅ MDX display and contentlayer
    - for later: we can probably parameterize pages, by customizing the Mdx, mdx-component and modifying the [...slug]/page.tsx
    - need to be careful with Mdx to make sure we can get the right data in or out and we can navigate correctly

5. Notes navigation
6. Readme
